"Description:A Day in the life:The Red Alpha Data Science practice grew out of Red Alpha's reputation in Software and System Engineering with our Department of Defense clients. As sometimes happens, customers who trust our expertise in adjacent areas asked Red Alpha to assist with some of their burgeoning Data Science problems.Culturally, it probably suffices to say that we take our work seriously, but not ourselves. Our leaders have spent time in the trenches and have cursed daylight savings time changes and trailing whitespace as many times as you have. We like to say that we spend 80% of our time cleaning the data...and 20% of our time complaining about cleaning the data. Joking aside, our voices matter, and it is easy to see how our decisions affect the Data Science practice and Red Alpha as a whole. We have a clear vision of where we are headed and would love to share it with you.Our process can be a little bit different from some other companies; we tend to hire data scientists slowly, after we have gotten to know people a little bit, and this job posting is the mechanism for initiating that process. Most of our recent hires were the product of ongoing conversations that resulted in a formal fit when the timing was right for both of us. This does mean we sometimes miss out on potential hires, but we believe there are a lot of good people out there; we are willing to wait not only for the right person, but also for the right timing. It has been a successful recipe so far.. Requirements:What you bring to the table:Now on to the fun of formal requirements-we have to apologize in advance for the corporate-speak here, but just hold your breath for a few lines and everything will be okay. You will need:A B.S. Degree in Data Science, Mathematics, Computer Science or related field.For mid/senior-level data scientists, at least 3 years of experience managing teams.For mid/senior-level data scientists, at least 6 years of experience on data science projects.A TS/SCI with Polygraph security clearance.A bit more informally, though, you should have experience with Python, R, Hadoop, Spark, Random Forests, Deterministic Forests (jk), Jupyter Notebooks, xkcd, Deep Learning, and a host of other tools and techniques: you do not need to know them all, but you should be comfortable and capable with quite a few of them. You might not be at the top of the list to be a game show host, but you do like people and enjoy solving problems jointly with your colleagues.Why Red Alpha?A few of our perks and benefits:You can retire sooner rather than planned: Get closer to retirement with up to 12% in 401k contributions.You can have a career AND a life: Enjoy up to 5 weeks of leave (up to 25 days of personal time off) and 10 paid holidays.You can stay at your best: As a member, we'll pay 100% of your premiums for comprehensive health, dental, and vision insurance. We'll also pay the majority of the premiums for your family.Free access to a fully equipped state of the art gym!$300 per year in company branded merchandise (Under Armour, Nike, Carhartt, YETI, etc.)Fun events throughout the year including a holiday gala, whisky tastings, fall festivals, happy hours, and more.,Data Scientist - Multiple Levels"

"LOCATION: Remote (home based) with some travel to New York, Washington DC, Boston.About Us VIDEOFounded in 2013, Pivotal Software, Inc. combines our leading cloud-native platform, tools, and methodology to empower the world's largest organizations to adapt to change and build great software. Our technology unleashes developer productivity, while fulfilling our mission to transform how the world builds software.YouAs a data scientist on Pivotal's Data Science team, you'll be working on a wide variety of data problems for a diverse range of clients. You will often be asked to learn new technologies and domains on the fly. You should be comfortable working under deadlines and making tough decisions. Consequently, you will frequently have to balance achieving an immediate goal with scalability and productionalizability.The role offers room for personal and professional growth, and you won't be working in isolation. Data Science at Pivotal is an encouraging and supportive team, where ideas and challenges are addressed collaboratively. We're looking for the kind of person who will try and solve a problem on their own first, but isn't afraid to ask for help or say ""I don't know.""UsThe Data Science team at Pivotal is primarily a consulting practice; we are tool agnostic, working with our customers to solve real world problems. Our customers, like us, are cross-disciplinary. We service engagements with use cases running from customer churn to optimization to detecting fraud and misconduct. We are not just doers, we are also educators and enablers.Your DayWhile there is no such thing as a ""typical day"", these are activities we frequently find ourselves doing:Working with clients to uncover and frame new opportunities for data science. Clients often come to us without a clear understanding of what we can do, so this is our chance to open their eyes to new possibilities for their businesses.Exploring client datasets, looking for actionable insights we can present.Engineering features, training models, tuning hyperparameters and evaluating the results. We emphasize rigor, because data science done right at this stage leads to models that shine in production.Taking the models we build into production. This is an exciting stage for anyone who likes collaborating with engineering teams and seeing their model become real when users interact with it.Helping our clients develop their internal data science practices, from hiring and recruiting to data capturing, so that they can be successful when we hand off the project.Required Skills / ExperiencesClear and empathetic communicator. You'll be the one sharing your insights with clients and stakeholders at check-ins, documenting your work, and even explaining your model to client data teams as part of a handoff. As such, communication and empathy are essential parts of your toolkit.Advanced knowledge of statistical modeling and/or machine learning methods. These are the tools we need to go from analysis to prediction.Strong programming skills. Left to our own devices most of us work in Python, but learning the client's tech stack is an important part of the job.Strong exploratory data analysis skills. Every engagement starts with an investigation of the data, and thorough EDA saves us a lot of headaches in the long run.Some travel is expected, depending on location and skillset. We mostly work out of the Pivotal office closest to the client, but sometimes we have to be on site for an extended period of time.At least a bachelor's degree in an analytical or technical field. This could be applied mathematics, statistics, computer science, operations research, economics, etc. Higher education welcome and encouraged.This role will support US government clients that require US citizenship. Given this, US citizenship is required for you to apply.Desired Skills / Experiences2+ years of work in a data-centric field (data science or data engineering).Experience with relational databases.Exposure and experience working in a Linux environment.You have a specialization in an area like NLP, optimization, or image processing.Hands-on experience working in a distributed computing environment or proven theoretical understanding of parallelism.Pivotal is an Equal Employment Opportunity employer that will consider all qualified applicants, regardless of race, color, religion, gender, sexual orientation, marital status, gender identity or expression, national origin, genetics, age, disability status, protected veteran status, or any other characteristic protected by applicable law.,Data Scientist"

Don't avoid a problem because ""someone else 'owns' the code"" - learn the code, learn the domain, solve the problem.ALWAYS A MENTOR - Continually look for the chance to share your knowledge and skills with others. Even the most seasoned professional can learn new tricks from the most junior developer. There is always something you know that someone else doesn't (and vice versa), so share!EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION - Write and speak clearly and concisely. Be prepared to explain your work, decisions, and ideas to your colleagues. Graciously challenge ideas that don't seem right, no matter where they originate.GOOD TEAMMATE - Have a sense of humor. Build relationships with your colleagues. Work out differences with your colleagues directly. Go to your manager if you're unable to resolve it there. Actively work to disrupt backchannel and office politics. Look for ways to make the work environment better for everyone.,Senior Software Engineer - Cloud (QuoteCenter)"
